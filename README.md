# Mirage Demo

> good luck - fiig

This is the original demo prototype for Mirage (notice the old spelling "Miirage", I know ðŸ™„). 

The project is built using SwiftUI and includes the main original components:

- Map View - this is where the app will open (once logged in or whatever) and will show the pieces in your close vicinity
- AR View - self explanatory, but this is how you see the AR pieces within their context 
- Social Feed - fully open to suggestions here
- Profile - again, this might feel a little web2ish we can have discussions on where we could take this

Please reach out to me on discord if you have any issues getting this project setup - Fiig
